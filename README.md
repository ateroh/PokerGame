# Project 3 - Online - Poker

> Replace 3 with your group number. Replace Online - Poker with your project's name.

# Abstract

> This project implements a distributed multiplayer poker game using tuple spaces for coordination and JavaFX for the graphical interface. The system follows a model view controller paired with a client-server architecture where a central server manages game state through tuple space repositories, while multiple clients connect remotely to participate. 

The server handles player registration, card dealing, and game flow management through coordinated tuple operations. Communication occurs using blocking and non-blocking tuple space operations for turn management . The client uses the MVC pattern, automatically updating
the JavaFX interface. Players can join games, place bets (fold, call, raise), and compete in Texas Hold'em poker using standard rules and hand evaluation.

# Demo video

> Add here a link to a video showing how your project runs. The video does not need to explain anything about how you designed or coded your project. Just show how it runs. There is no time limit or specific format. You can put it on YouTube or similar.

Demo video: https://youtu.be/paWE-GvDO1c?si=SR6srFgJOtMZ1ECE

> If your demo video uses one single computer (as it would be easier to screencast), please add a link to an additional video showing that it can also run on multiple computers.

> As a back-up, please upload the videos as part of your submission.

# Main coordination challenge

> Most likely you have been addressing and sovling many coordination challenges. Which one was the most challenging? Which solution are you most proud?. Choose just one. Use a few diagrams to illustrate the challenge and the solution. Use a few paragraphs to explain it. Refer to the materials from the mandatory materials (modules 1-3) and recommended materials (modules 4-6, Klempmann's course, etc.). That is, use the precise terminology and add references. This part shold not be longer than 2 screens (approx.).

# Programming language and coordination mechanism

> If you use a tuple space library from [pSpaces](https://github.com/pSpaces) just write something like "This project is based on the tuple space library X" where X is jSpace, dotSpace, etc.
> If you use something else implement coordination, you will have to describe here how the coordination concepts and mechanisms in the frameworks you use relate to the ones we use in the course. For example, if you decide to use Erlang you will have to explain inboxes and all that in terms of tuple spaces. The goal should be that anyone that has followed the couse materials, should be able to understand what you did, even if you decided not to use pSpaces libraries.

# Installation

> Provide here installation requirements and instructions. Your goal here is that anyone else following the course should be able to follow the steps and run your project.

# References 
> List here the main references that you have been using in your text above (course materials, articles, webtsites, etc.)
